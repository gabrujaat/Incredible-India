Extra Touches
Add hover effects for cards (slight scale-up and shadow)

Use tricolour gradient in small UI details (menu hover underline, buttons, section titles)

Maybe include a scroll-to-top button

💡 On your menu idea: Instead of making it too broad, I’d keep:

Home

Why Incredible?

Places (could be a dropdown for “States”)

Experiences (could be a dropdown for “Adventure” & “Culture”)

Contact

That keeps it clean but still allows for expansion.
